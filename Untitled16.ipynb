            " This is a summary of Mr. Kishan Goud's lab results from February 1st, 2021.  These results are explained in simple terms; however, you should always discuss them with your doctor for a proper interpretation.\n",
            "\n",
            "**1. Typhoid Tests (Widal Test):**  These tests check for typhoid fever. The results show some antibodies, but not high enough to definitely diagnose typhoid.  Further evaluation may be needed.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Dengue Tests:** Tests for dengue fever (a mosquito-borne illness) were negative.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):** This test measures how quickly red blood cells settle in a tube.  Your result (26 mm/hr and 52 mm/hr) is elevated, suggesting possible inflammation.\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. Malaria Test:** This rapid test for malaria was negative.\n",
            "\n",
            "**5. Complete Blood Count (CBC):** This is a comprehensive blood test.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Hemoglobin (Hb):**  13.6 gm% (normal). This measures the oxygen-carrying capacity of your blood.\n",
            "*   **Red Blood Cells (RBC):** 4.3 million/cumm (slightly low, but within the normal range for many).\n",
            "*   **White Blood Cells (WBC):** 7,200 cells/cumm (normal). These fight infection.\n",
            "*   **Platelets:** 2.0 lakhs/cumm (normal). These help with blood clotting.\n",
            "*   **Other Blood Cell Types:**  All within the normal range.\n",
            "\n",
            "**6. HbA1c:**  5.4% (normal). This test indicates your average blood sugar level over the past few months.  This is within the normal range, and shows good blood sugar control.\n",
            "\n",
            "**7. Serum Creatinine:** 0.8 mg/dl (normal). This is a measure of kidney function.\n",
            "\n",
            "**8. Random Blood Glucose:** (Result missing from provided text)  This measures your current blood sugar level.\n",
            "\n",
            "**9. Liver Function Tests (LFTs):**  All liver function tests were within normal ranges.\n",
            "\n",
            "**10. Serum Electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Chloride):** Sodium is slightly low (122 mmol/l), while potassium and chloride are within the normal range.\n",
